                <p>I first conduct user interviews, usability testing, and other research methods to understand users' needs and preferences. Then I create intuitive and engaging user interfaces that are easy to use and visually appealing. I organize complex information and content into clear and easy-to-understand structures.
                    And finally, create high-fidelity interactive prototypes to test and iterate on design concepts. I conduct usability testing to validate design decisions and identify areas for improvement.</p>

                <img src="../UX_UI_HW_18/images/Design Process.png" alt="Design Process">
                <p>My design process is collaborative, user-centered, and iterative. I typically start with  conducting research to understand user needs, business goals, and competitors. Then generate ideas through sketching, brainstorming, and collaboration. Once the brainstorming phase is complete, I create interactive prototypes to test and iterate on design concepts. I conduct usability testing to   validate design decisions and identify areas for improvement. And finally, I work with developers to ensure the design is implemented accurately and effectively.</p>

                <img src="../UX_UI_HW_18/images/Soft Skills.png" alt="Soft Skills">
                <p>In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong soft skills that enable me to work effectively in a team and deliver successful UX projects. These skills include: communicating effectively with stakeholders, developers, and designers. Working in a team environment where I value the input of others. I approach design problems with a user-centered mindset and empathize with users to create solutions that meet their needs. And I am comfortable with ambiguity and am able to pivot when needed to ensure project success.</p>
